The leader of the local [[Camarilla]], she heads the vampire populace in Manchester regardless of the lower kindred's thoughts on her rule. The prince of Manchester is a [[Malkavian]] who has the [[Seneschal]] under a minor blood bond as part of her position.

The prince came into power during Mithras' disappearance in the 1940s in London which rippled into the court of Manchester and power shifted handed. The once-Scourge now took the ex-Prince into her fangs and stole their place. This was initially a heavily challenged move and it took many decades before tempers simmered and the new normal of the mad queen of the court was established.

With this new normal came unlikely allies and new affordances. The Tremere made home in Manchester with the [[Seneschal]] taking her place at the prince's right hand side. Lasombra made a name for themselves as Camarilla aligned before 2019, even predating the fall of london.

The prince holds specific distain for [[Thin-Blood]] and [[Caitiff]], ordering sweeps of the population where resources allow. Bringing the prince into a political headway with the [[Baron Emily Davison]].
